# dbhandler

Requirements: PHP 5.4+

These classes are made to simplify database operations via the PHP PDO interface.

Using PDO's native methods makes for a lot of code bloat, so I've made this project
to avoid that. There are also some pitfalls that I've worked around.

Code examples can be found in test.php.
